        <h1>Order Package Tracking</h1>
        <p>Within the realm of zone-based picking processes, a practice requires the creation of multiple packages for a single order. The system diligently identifies each of these packages that are destined to arrive at the packing station, taking into account all items contained within the orders. By meticulously considering the composition of these packages, the system accurately determines the total volume of items that collectively form the entirety of the order.</p>
    </div>
    <div className='second-div-packageandshipping'><h1>Intelligent Packing Sizing Algorithms</h1>
    <p>The AI-powered package optimization system utilizes advanced algorithms to analyse order dimensions and packaging constraints. By considering these factors, the system generates optimized packaging solutions that maximize space utilization and minimize material wastage. This intelligent approach results in efficient packaging configurations.</p></div>
    <div className='third-div-packageandshipping'>
        <h1>Real-Time Packaging Recommendations</h1>
        <p>The system provides real-time recommendations to warehouse staff on the most suitable packaging options for each order. It considers variables such as fragility, weight, and compatibility to ensure that items are packaged securely and efficiently. These recommendations guide warehouse staff in making informed packaging decisions.</p>
